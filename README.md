Optimizers: 
- numpy implementation of SGD with Momentum, RMSprop and Adam.

Regularization:
- Dropout and Batch Normalization. Implemented in numpy.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
- Create a CNN using Tensorflow.

Data Augmentation:
- Data augmentation is very useful for CNNs. It can enrich the collected datasets by enlarging them using the operations on the original data samples. It can promote the performance of networks. Create a data generator which does several augmentations.

Bottle Kaggle Competition:
- "Bottle classification problem". TensorFlow 1.13 used to build model.
